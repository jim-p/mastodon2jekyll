# mastodon2jekyll.py

Script to convert the contents of a Mastodon export archive to Jekyll posts.

It may work for any ActivityPub-compatible platform, but I have only tried it
with Mastodon.

Edit the variables at the top of the script to match the desired content and
format.

Requires BeautifulSoup4 and pyyaml, other needs should all be in the standard
library.
